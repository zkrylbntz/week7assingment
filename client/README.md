Wow, so this week I feel very proud of my accomplishments. I think I've hit the nail on the head this week. I've got my client running in React - POSTing to my Database, from the form. And GETting information from both seed data, and inputs from my form. I've seperated these into two seperate 'pages' with my GET information displaying through Map. It is just this moment as I write this, before changing my links that I have forgotten about media queries, ahhh. I know I say it every week but it didn't really enter my mind up until now. I've been a bit lost in the styling, which I am somewhat pretty happy with, it looks a bit more professional. I tried to implement a few little bit I learnt along the way this week, some conditional rendering in the GET information.

I had a couple good debugging sessions with Ashir again which I think we both learnt some very valuable syntax error, the odd 's' in a http stopping from GET and a closing bracket not allowing me to send information as a POST! I Googled a couple styling issues but very simple bits.

I think as a whole it all went well, I did have a little panic at the very last minute, I decided to add a row, with more data and then it threw an error with which I paniced and hadn't stated this new information anywhere on my server, Ashir helped again. But in that moment I froze, definitley wish I had of kept it how it was, but again a learning experience!
